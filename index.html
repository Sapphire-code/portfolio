        <h2>🌮 My Hobbies</h2>

        <h3>👨‍💻programming</h3>
        <p>
          programming is one of my main hobbies due to the fact that you get to create things and fix problematic issues with your code. Another thing is that my coding skills are mid 💀
        </p>
        <h3>👨‍🔬Physics</h3>
        <p>
          I absolutely love physics! It is my favourite subject since primary school and hope to persue it in the future. I love physics because it uncovers the true nature of reality and has an explanation for everything that we need to understand.
        </p>
        <h3>Mathematics</h3>
        <p>
          When I was a kid, I used to hate maths, due to the fact that it was too difficult. I have now realized that math is actually enjoyable if you spend some time with it and eventually you start having fun in math and start to practice.
